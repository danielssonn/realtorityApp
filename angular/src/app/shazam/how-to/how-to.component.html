    Discover current listings, anywhere you are. With one tap on the screen. <br>
    
    <br>
    
    Ever see a 'SOLD' sign while walking by, wondering how much the house sold for? We'll show you the most recent sale at an address around you, from the past one year. <br> <br>


    We'll also show you all the current listings 'nearby'. This is typically one to two city blocks, so you can easily get there to check it out. <br><br>

   
    And you can give us a call or send a text if you want to visit any house, anytime! <br> <br>

    For homes, we'll show you sales from the past year on the street around you. <br><br>

    For condos, we'll show you last few sales at a given address. You can adjust the street number. <br><br>

    The sales information is limited to last one year, to keep it current.
